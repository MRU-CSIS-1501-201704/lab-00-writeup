# Lab 0: Intro to MRU Computer Labs

## In this lab, **I** will:

* [ ] briefly introduce you to the 3 MACO labs, give their access details, and explain why it can be beneficial to do your work there instead of elsewhere.
* [ ] tell you about the Instructional Assistants (IAs), who are paid to help you with a variety of problems you might face over the semester.
* [ ] make sure your computer account is accessible and set up correctly.
* [ ] give a quick tour of our course's Blackboard site, which is an important resource used throughout the course.
* [ ] provide a brief overview of the network locations you will use in this and other courses.
* [ ] introduce you to BlueJ, which is the Java development environment for this course.
* [ ] make sure you have a GitHub account, which is required to both receive and submit your assignments.
* [ ] give you a taste of how GitHub will be used in the course by having you submit something.

## In this lab, **you** will:

* [ ] submit a BlueJ project with your course "handle" in it via GitHub.

### If you are coming to this **after** the lab period is over

You have some digging to do on your own.

* Making a GitHub account is straightforward - Google it up.
* Wander through our Blackboard site to get a feel for what's available. If you can't even *get* to the site, talk to an Instructional Assistant (IA).
* Doing a practice submission is covered in more detail in the next section.
* Any other questions should be bounced off an IA:

### Practice submission

#### Prerequisites

* You can get onto the 1501-001 Blackboard site.
* You have a GitHub account.

#### Submission Steps

1. Request your own private copy of the lab's starting project.
    1. Go to the lab section in our Blackboard site and follow the `Lab 00` link. _You may be asked to authorize GitHub. Do it. What's the worst that could happen?_
    1. Accept the assignment.
1. Bring the starting project onto your computer.
    1. Open up BlueJ > Tools > Team > Checkout Project
    1. Fill out the resulting dialog box in a rational manner.
        1. _Your repository URI can be found at [github.com/MRU-CSIS-1501-201704-001]._
    1. Save the project in a reasonable place on your local machine. (In the labs, the H drive is more reasonable than the C drive.)
1. Edit the README.TXT file so it contains your course handle.
1. Submit your project.
    1. Use the Commit/Push button.
    1. A simple commit comment (for example, "Add handle.") is fine.
    1. Don't forget to `Push` after you `Commit`.
